## Draft ERC - Managing lists for trusted identifiers

### Introduction

It is increasing clear that we will need a way to use identifiers in the blockchain space, so much so that there needs to be an easy way to manage issuers of identifiers and easily query them when necessary.

### Purpose of this ERC

The purpose of this ERC is to provide a coherent way to manage issuers and query them.

### What's included in this draft

In this draft, we have include a basic implementation and interface as well as examples of using such a list in future.
In recent news, the New Zealand government banned the purchase of property from foreigners, we believe this is the perfect example use case for this ERC as it can demonstrate how we can check an identifier issuer against a buy claim.
