## ERC - Merkle Tree Attestations

### Introduction

With the advent of blockchains like Ethereum, we are able to validate identifiers which attest to a users identity or credentials. This ERC outlines a way we can validate a users identifiers in an efficient and privacy enabled way which can be used both on chain and off chain.

### Purpose

The purpose of this ERC is to show how a simple merkle tree attestation can be pulled off inside a smart contract and used for services like the ones outlined here (TODO add link)

With a merkle tree attestation, we can validate only the needed information for a user while keeping the rest off chain.

For example, if Alice wants to buy property in New Zealand, she should only have to show that she is a Citizen of New Zealand and above the age of 18. It is not necessary for her to reveal her exact birth date or even her full name.

### Draft implementation
