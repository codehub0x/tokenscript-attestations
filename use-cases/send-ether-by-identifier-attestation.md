# Problem

A user, Alice, wishes to send ether to Bob who might not have an Ethereum address. Alice, however, knows an identifier of Bob that can be attested. e.g. Bob‚Äôs email address or Bob‚Äôs mobile phone number. 

The identifier to be attested, (email address or mobile number‚Ä†), can‚Äôt be learned from an observer with access to the Ethereum blockchain. However, it will be possible for Alice to see that Bob receives cheques from other parties in the future.

This approach is done by Alice sending a virtual and anonymous *cheque* to Bob.

We wish to ensure that only Bob (the attested owner of the identifier *and* the person holding a copy of the cheque) can cash the cheque. This means that neither a malicious attester (or someone controlling Bob's identifier), nor a man-in-the-middle who might extract the cheque, will be able to cash the cheque alone.

Furthermore, we want to allow Bob to be able to reuse his attestation once it is made. So that after receiving a cheque from Alice, he can also receive a cheque from Carol using his attestation without the need for Alice or Carol to communicate. 

The protocol is secure under any composition of senders (Alices) and receivers (Bobs) based on a one-more discrete logarithm-like assumption. 

# Protocol

- We assume that both Alice and Bob knows Bob's identifier ùëñ.
- We use *g<sup>x</sup>* to denote the generator element, *g*, taken *x* times as apposed to *G¬∑x* in some other works (when using elliptic curve notation).

## Attestation
This only needs to be done once for Bob and can be done either before or after receiving the first cheque.

1. Bob generates an Ethereum key (if he hasn't already) and a privacy key *p*.

2. Bob creates the corresponding subject of attestation *s=H(i)<sup>p</sup>*.

3. Bob signs a CSR (signing request) with his identifier *i* two times, one with his Etheruem key and one with *p* (viewing it as a private key for ECDSA).

4. An attestor verifies that Bob owns the identifier, both signatures are valid, then issue an attestation that binds his Ethereum address with the subject *s*.

### Cheque

1. Alice wishes to send Bob some Ether and knows Bob‚Äôs identifier *i*. She creates a one-time-key *p'*, computes *s'=H(i)<sup>p'</sup>*.

2. Alice writes a cheque for anyone to redeem a certain amount of Ether from her smart contract. The cheque requires an *x* such that *s'=s<sup>x</sup>* for a valid attestation on subject *s*.

3. Alice sends *p'* and the cheque to Bob.

### Redeem the Cheque with the Attestation

Bob computes a value *x=p<sup>-1</sup>p'* and, in a redeeming transaction, and constructs a Fiat-Shamir based Schnorr proof-of-knowledge that it knows *x* s.t. *s'=s<sup>x</sup>*. That is, Bob proceeds as follows:
1. Pick random *r* and compute *t=s<sup>r</sup>*
2. Next compute *c=H(s, s', t)*
3. Finally compute *d=r+c\*x*
4. Bob then sends *(s, s', t, d)* and the the attestation (whose subject is *s*) to the smart contract.

The smart contract computes:

1. That the amount in the attestation is less than Alice‚Äôs balance.
2. The attestation is a valid attestation that binds *s* to Bob (transaction sender)‚Äôs Ethereum address.
3. *c=H(s, s', t)* and verifies that *s<sup>d</sup>=t\*s'<sup>c</sup>*

If all predicates are satisfied, emits the pay to Bob.

# Implementation Issues
We note that despite having described the protocol using general multiplication group notation, what will actually be implement will be based on elliptic cruves. This means that *s* will actually be a point on an elliptic curve computed as *G\*p* where *G* is a generator computed deterministically from *H(i)*. Furthermore, this also means that the computation in step 3 for Bob and the smart contract will happen over the integers, modulo the curve order. 
[This post](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/34863/ec-schnorr-signature-multiple-standard) mentions some standards for EC-based Fiat-Shamir Schnorr proofs and thus where to look for further details.

Furthermore, we note that there does not seem to be standard Javascript libraries to compute such an elliptic curve Fiat-Shamir Schnorr proof. Thus this could be allowed to be supported by a third party (specifically step 1-3 for Bob). However, if such a library is malicious it will learn *x* and thus be able to impersonate Bob. This *must* not happen. Thus instead of constructing a proof of knowledge of *x* s.t. *s'=s<sup>x</sup>* Bob uses such a library to cosntruct a proof of knowledge of *x+w* s.t. *s'=<sup>x+w</sup>* for a random *w*. Based on this Bob will instead send *(s, s', t, d, w)* in step 4 and the server will instead verify *s<sup>d</sup>=t\*s'<sup>c\*w</sup>* in step 3.
Still, even this approach does still allow for a front-running displacement attack in case the Javascript library sends the query to its owners who also do mining and so the miner will learn *x* and thus be able to impersonate Bob once he tried to cash the cheque.

However, it might still be possible to easily implement this in Javascript, as SubtleCrypto.deriveKey supports construction of an ECDH key which can be used to construct the value *r* and *t* in step 1 for Bob over an elliptic curve. Since hashing is also readily supported, step 2 can also easily be implemented. Furhtermore, Javascript also supports big integer arithmetic through BigInt, which is needed to compute step 3. Thus the only real issue that might not be trivial is to extract the BigInt representation of *r* along with the curve order.
